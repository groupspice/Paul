        <text><![CDATA[READ ME FIRSTWelcome to the Deepening Life Together study on Paul. For some of you, this might be the  rst time you’ve connected in a small group community. We want you to know that God cares about you and your spiritual growth. As you prayerfully respond to the principles you learn in this study, God will move you to a deeper level of commitment and intimacy with himself, as well as with those in your small group.We at Baker Books and Lifetogether Publishing look forward to hearing the stories of how God changes you from the inside out during this small group experience. We pray God blesses you with all he has planned for you through this journey together.For the Lord is good and his love endures forever; his faithfulness continues through all generations.Psalm 100:5Session OutlineMost people want to live a healthy, balanced spiritual life, but few achieve this by themselves. And most small groups struggle to balance all of God’s purposes in their meetings. Groups tend to overemphasize one of the  ve purposes, perhaps fellowship or discipleship.Rarely is there a healthy balance that includes evangelism, ministry, and worship. That’s why we’ve included all of these elements in this study so you can live a healthy, balanced spiritual life over time.A typical group session will include the following:Memory VersesFor each session we have provided a Memory Verse that emphasizes an important truth from the session. This is an optional exercise, but we believe that memorizing Scripture can be a vital part of  lling our5]]></text>

We encourage you to give this important habit a try.CONNECTING with God’s Family (Fellowship)The foundation for spiritual growth is an intimate connection with God and his family. A few people who really know you and who earn your trust provide a place to experience the life Jesus invites you to live. This section of each session typically o ers you two activities.You can get to know your whole group by using the icebreaker question, and/or you can check in with one or two group members— your spiritual partner(s)—for a deeper connection and encouragement in your spiritual journey.DVD Teaching SegmentA Deepening Life Together: Paul Video Teaching DVD companion to this study guide is available. For each study session, the DVD contains a lesson taught by Mark Strauss. If you are using the DVD, you will view the teaching segment after your Connecting discus- sion and before your group discussion time (the Growing section).GROWING to Be Like Christ (Discipleship)Here is where you come face-to-face with Scripture. In core passages you’ll explore what the Bible teaches about the topic of the study. The focus won’t be on accumulating information but on how we should live in light of the Word of God. We want to help you apply the Scriptures practically, creatively, and from your heart as well as your head. At the end of the day, allowing the timeless truths from God’s Word to transform our lives in Christ is our greatest aim.DEVELOPING Your Gifts to Serve Others (Ministry)Jesus trained his disciples to discover and develop their gifts to serveothers. And God has designed each of us uniquely to serve him in 6]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[a way no other person can. This section will help you discover and use your God-given design. It will also encourage your group to discover your unique design as a community. In this study, you’ll put into practice what you’ve learned in the Bible study by taking a step to serve others. These simple steps will take your group on a faith journey that could change your lives forever.SHARING Your Life Mission Every Day (Evangelism)Many people skip over this aspect of the Christian life because it’s scary, relationally awkward, or simply too much work for their busy schedules. But Jesus wanted all of his disciples to help outsiders connect with him, to know him personally. This doesn’t mean preaching on street corners. It could mean welcoming a few newcomers into your group, hosting a short-term group in your home, or walking through this study with a friend. In this study, you’ll have an opportunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.SURRENDERING Your Life for God’s Pleasure (Worship)God is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group session will give you a chance to surrender your heart to God in prayer and worship. You may read a psalm together, share a page in your journal, or sing a song to close your meeting. If you have never prayed aloud in a group before, no one will pressure you. Instead, you’ll experience the support of others who are praying for you.Study NotesThis section provides background notes on the Bible passage(s) you examine in the Growing section. You may want to refer to these notes during your group meeting or as a reference for those doing additional study.7]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstFor Deeper Study (optional)Some sessions provide For Deeper Study. If you want to dig deeper into more Bible passages about the topic at hand, we’ve provided additional passages and questions. Your group may choose to do study homework ahead of each meeting in order to cover more bib- lical material. Or you as an individual may choose to study the For Deeper Study on your own. If you prefer not to do study homework, the Growing section will provide you with plenty to discuss within the group. These options allow individuals or the whole group to go deeper in their study, while still accommodating those who can’t do homework or are new to your group. You can record your discoveries in your journal. We encourage you to read some of your insights to a friend (spiritual partner) for accountability and support. Spiritual partners may check in each week over the phone, through e-mail, or at the beginning of the group meeting.Re ectionsOn the Re ections pages we provide Scriptures to read and re ect on between group meetings. We suggest you use this section to seek God at home throughout the week. This time at home should begin and end with prayer. Don’t get in a hurry; take enough time to hear God’s direction.Subgroup for Discussion and PrayerIf your group is large (more than seven people), we encourage you to separate into groups of two to four for discussion and prayer. This is to encourage greater participation and deeper discussion.8]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[A Hero’s TaleBiographies of the heroes of the American Revolution are consistent bestsellers. To take just one example, you can have your pick among American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Je erson (1998); Sworn on the Altar of God: A Religious Biography of Thomas Je erson (2001); or R. B. Bernstein’s simply titled Thomas Je erson (2003). Or perhaps you’d prefer Dumas Malone’s six-volume set, Je erson and His Time? Six volumes!There’s something compelling about the true story of a larger- than-life person—a complex  gure who changed the course of his- tory. Je erson was one of those history-changing men. He penned the Declaration of Independence. He helped shape the ideas on which the American Experiment is founded. He wrote, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” He was an inventor, an archaeologist, an ambassador, and a president.Yet it would be hard to argue that Je erson had more in uence on the course of human history than did the apostle Paul. Just as we sometimes take the idea of human rights for granted (although it was radical in Je erson’s day), so we may take for granted Paul’s radical words and deeds. But Paul, more than any other single person after Jesus, assured that Christianity became a cross-cultural movement rather than an obscure Jewish sect. He fought for the idea that one9INTRODUCTION]]></text>

He traveled thousands of miles on foot and by sea in order to plant the message of Christ in the key urban centers of the Roman Empire.Saul/PaulPaul’s letters reveal a brilliant, passionate, stubborn man who cared deeply for individual people. He was born Jewish in what is now Turkey and was trained by one of the great rabbis of the age to be zealously orthodox. He  ercely fought the followers of Jesus when their movement was young. The tale of his turnaround is the stu  of drama, as are his adventures by land and sea.In this study you’ll discover:• How Jesus invited this young hothead to change his life• How Paul responded to God’s call to share with others the message that had transformed him• How Paul the theologian unfolds a history-changing concept• How Paul cared for people as their pastor and mentorPaul’s two names re ect the two sides of his upbringing that became crucial in his ministry. Saul, his Jewish name, embodies his youthful immersion in the Hebrew Scriptures and the Jewish way of life. Paulus, the Roman name he had as a Roman citizen, re ects his upbringing in Tarsus, a city full of non-Jews, where Paul learned to speak  uent Greek and to relate to those outside his tight Jewish subculture. He was the ideal person to bridge the gospel from Judaism to the Roman world.In our day, when heroes are rare and quickly attacked, we need people we can look up to as models of following Christ with courage and love. Paul is one of the greatest.10]]></text>

Eventually his parents shipped him o  to New York to live with his brother, but Cruz chose a life on the streets.After a brutal beating by a gang member and an even more brutal initiation ceremony, Cruz joined the Mau Maus, one of the most feared gangs in 1950s New York. By wits and sheer ruthlessness, he worked his way up to gang leader. When an evangelist named David Wilkerson turned up in Cruz’s neighborhood and told him God loved him, Cruz threatened to kill him.But Wilkerson refused to quit. “You can cut me up in a million pieces and lay them in the street,” he said. “Every piece would still say I love you.”Eventually his message of God’s love got through, opening Cruz to feel guilt over his sin. The day after he let Wilkerson pray with him for God’s forgiveness, Cruz went to the police with some of his gang members to turn in their bricks, knives, and handguns.Cruz went back to school and later returned to his old neighborhood as an evangelist. After serving as director for David Wilkerson’s Teen Challenge, an outreach to troubled teens, he founded Nicky Cruz* Nicky Cruz with Jamie Buckingham, Run Baby Run (Gainesville, TX: Bridge-Logos, 1988), 4.11]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[PaulOutreach, touching thousands of lives over the last  fty years as a world-renowned evangelist.Few of us have conversion stories as dramatic as Nicky Cruz’s— but the apostle Paul’s conversion was even more stunning. We know we’re watching God at work when we see someone so full of hate change not only his beliefs but the whole direction of his life. In this session we’re going to see how God broke into Paul’s life to transform him from the man he was to the man he became.CONNECTING 10 min.Open your group with prayer, asking God to put his  nger on the areas of your life that he might want to transform through the study of Saul the persecutor. Pray that your group will gain an understanding of your faith journeys through the study of Saul’s conversion.As you begin, take time to pass around a sheet of paper on which to write down your contact information, including the best time and method for contacting you. Or pass around one of your study guides opened to the Small Group Roster. Then, someone volunteer to make copies or type up a list with everyone’s information and e-mail it to the group this week.1. Begin this  rst session by introducing yourselves. Include your name, what you do for a living, and what you do for fun. You may also include whether or not you are married, how long you have been married, how many children you have, and their ages. Also share what brought you to this Deepening Life Together: Paul small group study and what you expect to learn during the next few weeks.2. What is one way you’re di erent from the kind of person you were in high school?3. Whether your group is new or ongoing, it’s always important to re ect on and review your values together.

Choose values that will take your group to the next stage of intimacy and spiritual health.GROWING 45–50 min.Transformation rarely comes easily, especially to passionate, stubborn people like young Saul. Stephen, a disciple of Jesus, was claiming that the system of rituals and sacri ces that God ordained through the Law of Moses had come to an end with the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The Jewish leaders considered Stephen’s message blasphemy, so they stoned him. Saul heartily agreed with them. But change was coming.Read Acts 7:54–8:3 aloud.4. What can we learn about Saul from this passage?5. Saul’s passion for the Law of Moses prompted his ardent per- secution of the church. When have your passions moved you to take action—in either a positive or a negative way?Read Acts 9:1–31 aloud.6. Saul requested the permission of the high priest to travel to Damascus. What did Saul plan to do there (vv. 1–2)?7. On his way to Damascus, Saul was confronted with the blaz- ing glory of Jesus Christ. He was knocked to the ground, and Jesus spoke directly to him. Why do you think Jesus revealed himself to Saul in this extraordinary way?8. What do you suppose Saul was thinking after he heard “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me” (v. 4)?9. Why did Saul ask, “Who are you, Lord?” (v. 5)? 13]]></text>

The Lord appeared to his disciple Ananias in a vision and told him to go to Saul. What was Ananias’s response to God?13. What does the Lord’s statement “I will show him how much he must su er for my name” (v. 16) say about the way the Lord was transforming Saul’s life?14. Saul embraced faith in Jesus as Messiah immediately and wholly. What were Saul’s  rst actions as a believer?How do those actions display the radical transformation that was under way in him?15. In what ways was Saul still the same kind of person he had been before?16. What can we learn about God from the fact that he called one of the worst persecutors of Jesus’s followers to be one of his leading spokespeople?Saul’s transformation was from spiritual blindness to spiritual sight, from trust in himself to faith in God, and from an enemy of the church to an apostle of Jesus Christ. Saul’s passion for God never diminished, but his actions were transformed, motivated by his passion for the gospel.14]]></text>

One important way to discover and develop our God-given design is to partner with another Christian for spiritual con- nection and accountability. We call this a spiritual partnership. We strongly recommend each of you partner with someone in the group to help you in your spiritual journey during this study. This person will be your spiritual partner for the next several weeks. He or she doesn’t have to be your best friend, but will simply encourage you to complete the goals you set for yourself during this study. Following through on a resolu-15]]></text>

See the Leader’s Notes for instructions for establishing spiritual partners. Pair up now and discuss question 18.18. Few of us have conversion stories as dramatic as Saul’s. Still, how has God changed you, or how do you think he wants to change you?19. In the Appendix we’ve provided a Personal Health Plan, a chart for keeping track of your spiritual progress. You and your spiri- tual partner can use it for accountability to the goals you set for yourselves. See the Personal Health Plan for instructions. If time permits, complete the Connect and Grow questions of your Personal Health Plan and share your answers with your spiritual partner.SHARING 10 min.Saul is a powerful example of God’s ability to reach and save even the most impossible sinners. In Saul, God displays his mercy and unpredictability, as well as his ability to turn a person’s weaknesses into strengths for ministry. Saul realized the work of Christ in his life when he said to Timothy in 1 Timothy 1:13: “Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy.”20. What does God’s work in Saul’s life say about the sort of people with whom we should be sharing the good news of Christ?21. Use the Circles of Life diagram on page 15 to help you think of people you come in contact with on a regular basis who need to be connected in Christian community. Try to write two names in each circle. Consider the following ideas for reaching out to one or two of the people you list and make a plan to follow through with them this week:16]]></text>

It’s possible that you may need to help your friend overcome obstacles to come to a place where he or she can encounter Jesus. Does your friend need a ride to the group or help with child care?t Consider inviting a friend to attend a weekend church service with you and possibly to enjoy a meal together afterward. This can be a great opportunity to talk with someone about your faith in Jesus.t Is there someone who is unable to attend your group but who still needs a connection? Would you be willing to have lunch or co ee with that person, catch up on life, and share something you’ve learned from this study? Jesus doesn’t call all of us to lead small groups, but he does call every disciple to spiritually multiply his or her life over time.SURRENDERING 10 min.Saul fully surrendered his heart to God. His surrender was prompted by a conversion experience that few others have experienced. As believers, we should learn all we can about what it means to surrender our lives to our Lord and then act on it.22. Every believer should have a plan for spending time alone with God. At the end of each session, we have provided Re ec- tions for you to begin daily time with him. There are  ve daily Scripture readings with room to record your thoughts. These will o er reinforcement of the principles we are learning and develop the habit of time alone with God throughout the week.23. Before you close your group in prayer, answer this question: “How can we pray for you this week?” Write prayer requests on your Prayer and Praise Report in the Appendix and commit to praying for each other throughout the week.17]]></text>

The phrase “Law of Moses” can refer to these  ve books (also known as the Pentateuch) or to the legislation contained in these books.Pharisee: A Jewish sect whose members came from the Jewish middle class and established and controlled the synagogues. They taught that the way to God was through obedience to the law. They opposed Jesus for a variety of reasons: he would not accept the teachings of the oral law as binding; his popularity with the people made them jealous; he associated with sinners and tax collectors; and he accused them of hypocrisy and hardheartedness.“The Way”: The Way is a New Testament term used to describe the beliefs and way of life of the followers of Jesus Christ.Stoning: A form of capital punishment for certain o enses. Blasphemy is one of the o enses that required this punishment (Lev. 24:14, 16, 23).Damascus: Damascus, a key commercial city, was located about 175 miles northeast of Jerusalem in the Roman province of Syria. Several trade routes linked Damascus to other cities throughout the Roman Empire.Apostleship: One sent with a special message or commission. Paul is an apostle because he saw the risen Lord and was directly commissioned by him (1 Cor. 9:1; 15:8).Ananias: A Jew who had become a believer in Christ.Grecian: Greek-speaking. Jews who were native to the Holy Land spoke Aramaic, while those who came from other parts of the empire spoke Greek.18]]></text>

Going from house to house, he dragged o  men and women and put them in prison. Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went” (Acts 8:3–4).• “Now those who had been scattered by the persecution in connection with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, telling the message only to Jews. Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus. The Lord’s hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord” (Acts 11:19–21).• “The church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace. It was strengthened; and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it grew in numbers, living in the fear of the Lord” (Acts 9:31).ReflectionsEach day, give prayerful consideration to what you learn about God, his Spirit, and his place in your life. Then record your thoughts, insights, or prayer in the Re ect section below the verses you read. On the sixth day, record a summary of what you learned over the entire week through this study.Day 1. You know what I was like when I followed the Jewish religion— how I violently persecuted the Christians. I did my best to get rid of them. I was one of the most religious Jews of my own age, and I tried as hard as possible to follow all the old traditions of my religion (Gal. 1:13–14 NLT).19]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSWhat do we do on the  rst night of our group?Like all fun things in life—have a party! A “get to know you” co ee, dinner, or dessert is a great way to launch a new study. You may want to review the Small Group Agreement and share the names of a few friends you can invite to join you. But most importantly, have fun before your study time begins.Where do we  nd new members for our group?This can be challenging, especially for new groups that have only a few people or for existing groups that lose a few people along the way. Pray with your group and then brainstorm a list of people from work, church, your neighborhood, your children’s school, family, the gym, and so forth. Then have each group member invite several of the people on his or her list. Another strategy is to ask church leaders to announce that your group is open to new members.No matter how you  nd members, it’s vital that you stay on the lookout for new people to join your group. All groups tend to go through healthy attrition—the result of moves, releasing new lead- ers, ministry opportunities, and so forth—and if the group gets too small, it could be at risk of shutting down. If you and your group stay open, you’ll be amazed at the people God sends your way. The next person just might become a friend for life. You never know!How long will this group meet?It’s up to the group—once you come to the end of this study. Most groups meet weekly for at least their  rst six months, but every other week can work as well. We recommend that the group meet for the  rst six months on a weekly basis if possible. This allows for continuity, and if people miss a meeting, they aren’t gone for a whole month.At the end of this study, each group member may decide whether heorshewantstocontinueonforanotherstudy.Somegroupslaunch50]]></text>

Either way, enjoy the journey.What if this group is not working for me?Personality con icts, life stage di erences, geographical distance, level of spiritual maturity, or any number of things can cause you to feel the group doesn’t work for you. Relax. Pray for God’s direc- tion, and at the end of this study decide whether to continue with this group or  nd another. You don’t buy the  rst car you look at or marry the  rst person you date, and the same goes with a group. Don’t bail out before the study is  nished—God might have some- thing to teach you. Also, don’t run from con ict or prejudge people before you have given them a chance. God is still working in you too!Who is the leader?Most groups have an o cial leader. But ideally, the group will mature and members will share the facilitation of meetings. Healthy groups share hosting and leading. This ensures that all members grow, give their unique contribution, and develop their gifts. This study guide and the Holy Spirit can keep things on track even when you share leadership. Christ has promised to be in your midst as you gather. Ultimately, God is your leader each step of the way.How do we handle the child care needs in our group?This can be a sensitive issue. We suggest that you empower the group to openly brainstorm solutions. Try one option that works for a while and then adjust over time. Our favorite approach is for adults to share the cost of a babysitter (or two) who can watch the kids in a di erent part of the house. In this way, parents don’t have to be away from their young children all evening. A second option is to use one home for the kids and a second home (close by) for the adults. A third idea is to rotate the adults who provide a lesson or care for thechildreneitherinthesamehomeorinanotherhomenearby.This can be an incredible blessing for kids. Finally, the most common idea is to decide that you need to have a night to invest in your spiritual lives individually or as a couple, and make your own arrangements for child care. Whatever the decision, the best approach is to dialogue openly about both the problem and the solution.51]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[TEAM ROLESThe Bible makes clear that every member, not just the small group leader, is a minister in the body of Christ. In a healthy small group, every member takes on some small role or responsibility. It can be more fun and e ective if you team up on these roles.Review the team roles and responsibilities below, and have each member volunteer for a role or participate on a team. If someone doesn’t know where to serve or is holding back, as a group, suggest a team or role. It’s best to have one or two people on each team so you have each of the  ve purposes covered. Serving in even a small capacity will not only help your leader but also will make the group more fun for everyone. Don’t hold back. Join a team!The opportunities below are broken down by the  ve purposes and then by a crawl (beginning), walk (intermediate), or run (advanced) role. Try to cover at least the crawl and walk roles, and select a role that matches your group, your gifts, and your maturity.Team Roles Team Player(s)CONNECTING TEAM (Fellowship and Community Building)Crawl: Walk:Run:Host a social event or group activity in the  rst week or two.Create a list of uncommitted friends and then invite them to an open house or group social.Plan a twenty-four-hour retreat or week- end getaway for the group.Lead the Connecting time each week for the group._______________________________________________________________________________________GROWING TEAM (Discipleship and Spiritual Growth)Crawl:Coordinate the spiritual partners for the group.Facilitate a three- or four-person discus-sion circle during the Bible study portion of your meeting.55]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[SERVING COMMUNIONChurches vary in their treatment of Communion (or The Lord’s Supper). We o er one simple form by which a small group can share this experience together. You can adapt this as necessary, or omit it from your group altogether, depending on your church’s beliefs.Steps in Serving Communion1. Open by sharing about God’s love, forgiveness, grace, mercy, commitment, tenderheartedness, faithfulness, etc., out of your personal journey (connect with the stories of those in the room).2. Read the passage: “And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, ‘This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me’” (Luke 22:19).3. Pray and pass the bread around the circle.4. When everyone has been served, remind them that this repre-sents Jesus’s broken body on their behalf. Simply state, “Jesus said, ‘Do this in remembrance of me’ (Luke 22:19). Let us eat together,” and eat the bread as a group.5. Then read the rest of the passage: “In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, ‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you’” (Luke 22:20).6. Pray and serve the cups, either by passing a small tray, serving them individually, or having members pick up a cup from the table.7. When everyone has been served, remind them the juice repre- sents Christ’s blood shed for them, then simply state, “Take and drink in remembrance of him. Let us drink together.”8. Finish by singing a simple song, listening to a praise song, or having a time of prayer in thanks to God.Communion passages: Matthew 26:26–29; Mark 14:22–25; Luke 22:14–20; 1 Corinthians 10:16–21; 11:17–3461]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[PERFORMING A FOOTWASHINGScripture: John 13:1–17. Jesus makes it quite clear to his disciples that his position as the Father’s Son includes being a servant rather than being one of power and glory only.The Purpose of FootwashingTo properly understand the scene and the intention of Jesus, we must realize that the washing of feet was the duty of slaves and indeed of non-Jewish rather than Jewish slaves. Jesus placed himself in the position of a servant. He displayed to the disciples self-sacri ce and love. In view of his majesty, only the symbolic position of a slave was adequate to open their eyes and keep them from lofty illusions. The point of footwashing, then, is to correct the attitude that Jesus discerned in the disciples. It constitutes the permanent basis for mutual service, service in your group and for the community around you, which is laid on all Christians.When to ImplementThere are three primary places we would recommend you insert a footwashing:• during a break in the Surrendering section of your group• during a break in the Growing section of your group• at the closing of your groupA special time of prayer for each person as he or she gets his or her feet washed can be added to the footwashing time.62]]></text>

Remember who is in control; the time to worry is when you’re not worried. Those who are soft in heart (and sweaty palmed) are those whom God is sure to speak through.Seek support. Ask your leader, co-leader, or close friend to pray for you and prepare with you before the session. Walking through the study will help you anticipate potentially di cult questions and discussion topics.Bring your uniqueness to the study. Lean into who you are and how God wants you to uniquely lead the study.Prepare. Prepare. Prepare. Go through the session several times. If you are using the DVD, listen to the teaching segment and Leader Lifter. Consider writing in a journal or fasting for a day to prepare yourself for what God wants to do.Don’t wait until the last minute to prepare.Ask for feedback so you can grow. Perhaps in an e-mail or on cards handed out at the study, have everyone write down three things you did well and one thing you could improve on. Don’t get defensive, but show an openness to learn and grow.Prayerfully consider launching a new group. This doesn’t need to happen overnight, but God’s heart is for this to happen over time. Not all Christians are called to be leaders or teachers, but we are all called to be “shepherds” of a few someday.68]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Session One Saul the Persecutor Turned ApostleConnecting1. We’ve designed this study for both new and established groups, and for both seekers and the spiritually mature. New groups will need to invest more time building relationships with each other. Established groups often want to dig deeper into Bible study and application. Regardless of whether your group is new or has been together for a while, be sure to take time to connect at this  rst session.2. Each session will include an icebreaker question that should help to set the tone for the Growing section of your group time. It’s important in this  rst session to allow time for everyone to participate in this icebreaker.3. A very important item in this  rst session is the Small Group Agreement. An agreement helps clarify your group’s priorities and cast new vision for what the group can become. You can  nd this in the Appendix of this study guide. We’ve found that groups that talk about these values up front and commit to an agreement bene t signi cantly. They work through con icts long before people get to the point of frustration, so there’s a lot less pain.Take some time to review this agreement before your meeting. Then during your meeting, read the agreement aloud to the entire group. If some people have concerns about a speci c item or the agreement as a whole, be sensitive to their concerns. Explain that tens of thousands of groups use agreements like this one as a simple tool for building trust and group health over time.As part of this discussion, we recommend talking about shared ownership of the group. It’s important that each member have a role. See Team Roles. This is a great tool to get this important practice launched in your group.Also, you will  nd a Small Group Calendar in the Appendix for use in planning your group meetings and roles. Take a look at the calendar prior to your  rst meeting and point it out to the group so that each person can note when and where the group will meet, who will bring snacks, any important upcoming events (birthdays, anniversaries), etc.73LEADER’S NOTESSESSIONS]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s NotesGrowingHave someone read Bible passages aloud. It’s a good idea to ask ahead of time, because not everyone is comfortable reading aloud in public.4. Saul sided with those who killed Stephen, those who saw him as deserving death for blasphemy (Acts 8:1). He doesn’t appear to have been one of those who threw the stones, but afterward he became active in the persecution of those who claimed Jesus was the Messiah (v. 3). “Going from house to house” suggests a highly active role. See the Introduction and Study Notes for more background on Saul.6. Saul was zealous about eradicating the church. He was driven by sincere convictions about the teachings of the followers of “the Way.” Not only was Saul going to pursue them, he was going to arrest both men and women and bring them back as prisoners.7. Jesus doesn’t use such tactics routinely to get people’s attention. Possibly there was nothing subtler that would have gotten through to someone as hardheaded as Saul. But also, from 1 Corinthians 15:1–8 and Galatians 1:11–12 we know that Paul attached a special signi cance to this unique event. Seeing the resurrected Jesus in a physical manifestation quali ed him to be an apostle on the level of Peter and other eyewitnesses to the resur- rection, and to teach with apostolic authority. Jesus had a special mission for Saul, and for this he was called in a special way.10. Saul’s blindness possibly symbolized his spiritual blindness to the truth. His subsequent healing signi es his new insight into the truth of the gospel.12. Ananias knew of Saul and his campaign against the church and though he recognized the Lord’s voice, he was hesitant (Acts 9:13–14). Ananias went and did as the Lord commanded. Calling Saul “brother,” he recounted Jesus’s appearance on the road to Damascus and placed his hands on Saul so that Saul might see again and be  lled with the Holy Spirit. “Immedi- ately, something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he could see again” (v. 18). Saul was baptized and took some nourishment to regain his strength (vv. 18–19).14. Very quickly, Saul started to preach in the synagogues about what he had come to believe about Jesus. This risky behavior suggests that he was fully convinced and determined to change not only his opinions but his behavior.15. His passionate personality, religious zeal, and willingness to take bold ac- tion hadn’t changed. God was simply redirecting them.74]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s NotesDevelopingThis section enables you to help the group see the importance of developing their abilities for service to God.19. Spiritual partners will pair up during group time and/or through the week and use the Personal Health Plan to record plans and progress throughout our study of Paul. For many, spiritual partners will be a new idea, but we highly encourage you to try them for this study. It’s hard to start a spiritual practice like prayer or consistent Bible reading with no support. A friend makes a huge di erence.We recommend that men partner with men and women partner with women. Partners can check in with each other weekly either during your group meetings or outside the meeting. As leader, you may want to prayerfully decide who would be a good match with whom. Try to discern who might have good relational chemistry that may lead to a deeper connection. Remind people that this partnership isn’t forever; it’s just for a few weeks. Be sure to have extra copies of the Personal Health Plan available at this  rst meeting in case you need to have a group of three spiritual partners. It is a good idea for you to look over the Personal Health Plan before the meeting so you can help people understand how to use it.SharingJesus wants all of his disciples to help outsiders connect with him, to know him personally. This section should provide an opportunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.21. We provided a Circles of Life diagram for you and the group to use to help you identify people who need to be connected in Christian community. When people are asked why they never go to church, they often say, “No one ever invited me.” Remind the group that our responsibility is to invite people, but we are not responsible for how they respond. Talk to the group about the importance of inviting people; remind them that healthy small groups make a habit of inviting friends, neighbors, unconnected church members, co-workers, etc., to join their groups or join them at a weekend service. When people get connected to a group of new friends, they often join the church.The Circles of Life represent one of the values of the Small Group Agreement: “Welcome for Newcomers.” Some groups fear that newcomers will interrupt the intimacy that members have built over time. However, groups generally gain strength with the infusion of new blood. It’s like a river of living water  owing into a stagnant pond. Some groups remain permanently open, while others open periodically, such as at the beginning and ending of a study. Love grows by giving itself away. If your circle becomes75]]></text>

Each session will provide group members a chance to surrender their hearts to God in prayer and worship. Group prayer requests and prayer time should be included every week.22. This question is meant to encourage quiet time at home each day throughout the week. Here you can help the group see the importance of making time with God a priority. Read through this section and be prepared to help the group understand how important it is to  ll our minds with the Word of God. If people already have a good Bible reading plan and commitment, that is great, but you may have people who struggle to stay in the Word daily. Sometimes beginning with a simple commitment to a short daily reading can start a habit that changes a person’s life. The Re ections pages at the end of each session include verses that were either talked about in the ses- sion or support the teaching of the session. They are very short readings with a few lines to encourage people to write down their thoughts. Remind the group about these Re ections each week after the Surrendering section. Encourage the group to commit to a next step in prayer, Bible reading, or meditation on the Word.23. As you move to a time of sharing prayer requests, be sure to remind the group of the importance of con dentiality and keeping what is shared in the group within the group. Everyone must feel that the personal things they share will be kept in con dence if you are to have safety and bonding among group members.Use the Prayer and Praise Report in the Appendix to record your prayer requests. There you can keep track of requests and celebrate answers to prayer.For Deeper StudyWe have included an optional For Deeper Study section in most sessions. For Deeper Study provides additional passages for individual study on the topic of each session. If your group likes to do deeper Bible study, consider having members study the For Deeper Study passages at home between meetings.76]]></text>
